# Lazy desktop Organizer
> "I hate my cleaning my cluttered desktop as I am too lazy to do that, so I built this."
# Problem
My desktop gets filled with random files:
- PDFs
- screenshots
- zip files
- code
- notes
- word files
- ppt files
- videos
Manually creating folders for each one of them and dragging each file is boring and time-consuming.
## Solution
This Python script:
- scans a chosen folder
- detects each file's type using its extension
- automatically creates folders like 'Images','Docs','Code','Zips','Audio','Videos','Others'
- finds them and organizes them into the right folders

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Dbms084/lazy-desktop-organizer.git
2. Move into the project folder:
  cd lazy-desktop-organizer
3. Run the script:
  python src/organizer.py
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal:
  - Press Enter to use the Desktop path
  - Type y to confirm organizing
